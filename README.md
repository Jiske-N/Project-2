# taskmaster

## The Project

This project was designed as a management system for anyone who regularly works behind a computer. Users are able to create task cards with containing details such as due dates, titles, and written descriptions. The user can then manage these tasks by moving them between customisable descriptive columns which they themselves create to suit the situation.

Other features include:

-   An attractive welcome page showcasing some of the sites possible functionality.
-   A seamless user model which makes it easy to sign up and login.
-   Account management options allowing the user to update details such as username and email.
-   Authorisation control preventing access to most features without signing in.
